  💳 Payment Gateway (Dummy)
As part of the payment workflow for ticketed events, we have implemented a dummy payment gateway to simulate real-world payment interactions.

Features of the dummy gateway:

Mimics the behavior of a real payment processor.

Accepts fake payment details to simulate transactions.

Designed for testing UI flow and success/error states.

Prepares the system for future integration with real gateways like Razorpay, Stripe, or PayPal.

This simulation enables seamless development and testing of booking flows involving payments, without involving actual financial transactions.
